A session in Express.js is a way to store user data on the server side across multiple HTTP requests. Since HTTP is stateless (each request is independent), sessions provide a mechanism to maintain state and remember information about users between requests.
How Sessions Work

User visits your app → Server creates a unique session ID
Session ID sent to browser → Stored as a cookie
User makes requests → Browser sends session ID with each request
Server retrieves data → Uses session ID to find stored user data
Q) what is a passport.js 
passport.js is a popular authentication middleware for Node.js that simplifies the process of implementing various authentication strategies (local login, Google OAuth, Facebook, Twitter, etc.) in Express applications.
Why Use Passport?

Multiple Authentication Strategies - Local, OAuth, OpenID, etc.
Flexible & Modular - Use only what you need
Session Management - Integrates seamlessly with Express sessions
Large Ecosystem - 500+ authentication strategies available

Basic Setup
javascriptconst express = require('express');
const passport = require('passport');
const session = require('express-session');
const LocalStrategy = require('passport-local').Strategy;

const app = express();

User submits login form → POST to /login
Passport processes request → Runs LocalStrategy
Strategy validates credentials → Checks database
If valid → serializeUser() stores user ID in session
Future requests → deserializeUser() retrieves full user data
Protected routes → Check req.isAuthenticated()

Passport simplifies authentication by handling the complex parts (session management, strategy coordination, serialization) while giving you full control over the authentication logic and user data handling.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.Claude can make mistakes.

Q) what is app.use()


app.use() is a method in Express.js that registers middleware functions in your application. Middleware functions are functions that execute during the request-response cycle and can modify the request/response objects or end the request-response cycle.
What is Middleware?
Middleware functions have access to:

req (request object)
res (response object)
next (function to pass control to the next middleware)

Basic Syntax
javascriptapp.use([path], middleware_function)

// crud operation using moongoose 
import mongoose from 'mongoose';
import Blog from './model/Blog';

mongoose.connect("mongodb+srv://mongo:mongo@cluster0.eyhty.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority")

// Create a new blog post object // model 
const article = new Blog({
  title: 'Awesome Post!',
  slug: 'awesome-post',
  published: true,
  content: 'This is the best post ever',
  tags: ['featured', 'announcement'],
});



// Insert the article in our MongoDB database after creation of model 
await article.save();
// to find a single blog post 
import mongoose from 'mongoose';
import Blog from './model/Blog';


// Create a new blog post and insert into database
const article = await Blog.create({
  title: 'Awesome Post!',
  slug: 'awesome-post',
  published: true,
  content: 'This is the best post ever',
  tags: ['featured', 'announcement'],
});

console.log(article);

// save is used to update 
await article.save();
console.log(article);

//to delete 
const blog = await Blog.deleteOne({ author: "Jesse Hall" })
console.log(blog)

const blog = await Blog.deleteMany({ author: "Jesse Hall" })
console.log(blog)
